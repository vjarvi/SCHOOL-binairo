Game rules
Objective of the game is to fill the board (8X8 if not changed) with 0s and 1s with the following rules:
- each row and column must have same number of 0s and 1s.
- Three or more of the same number in a row is prohibited in every row and column.
At first user chooses between filling the board randomly or himself. If user chooses to fill the board himself,
he/she cannot break previously said rules. When starting method is selected and seed/input is written, press 'Start'. During and after
the game user can start completely new game by clicking 'reset'.

User can fill squares by clicking on them multiple times:
1 click = 0, 2 clicks = 1, and 3 clicks = empty square again. Right and wrong fills are allowed until 'Place'
button is clicked. If there is incorrectly filled squares, program will tell and they will turn red.
Once the button is pressed, you cannot change correctly put squares. Be careful before pressing 'Place'!
It is possible to legally fill squares so that game cannot by completed anymore.
Game is over when board is full and the time used is shown. There is option to pause the game and see 
rules.

Description of the code.
Code works by hiding and showing the right buttons at the right time. For example when game is started,
'checkbox_random', 'checkbox_input' and other useless features are hidden. They are shown again when 'pushbutton_reset'
is pressed. 
Gameboard is generated when 'pushbutton_start' is pressed. draw_board()- method copies board_- map from GameBoard class
to different map called 'buttons_'. buttons_ contains QPushbutton objects. Each empty button can show 0, 1 or empty.
When 'pushbutton_place_number' (Place button) is pressed, 'on_pushbutton_place_number_clicked()' iterates through every
button/square that is edited and checks using gameboard class if its correctly placed. 
If yes, it is saved to the original board_ map and button is locked. If no, text in button turns red and can still be
edited. 
When 'pushbutton_reset()' is pressed, gameboard disappears by removing every QPushbutton objects from map. Timer also start/stops
when Start and Reset buttons are pressed.


Extra features
- background turns yellow/gold when game is over. Turns back when 'reset' is clicked.
- The game allows to make an erroneus addition warning the user and showing mistakes in red.
  Red numbers can be changed, but not others.
- Help button for rules. Just shows 'textbrowser_rules' when clicked and hides it after clicked again.
- Pause button stops timer and prevents playing the game by hiding everything else than 'pushbutton_pause'
  and 'label_general'.
